# DeepLearning Applications in Heart Diseases Using ECG Images
Early diagnosis is essential because cardiovascular illnesses are the main cause of death worldwide although manual examination of ECG Images is subjective and time consuming it offers crucial insights into cardiac function an effective substitute for automating and improving ECG based diagnostics is deep learning CNN, VGG16 and hybrid models are used in this study to categorise ECG data into diagnostic groups to determine the most accurate method we assess model performance using dataset from mendeley
